"Okay man, I'll see you tomorrow" Juno says to Gerald.

After Practice

'You have one notifictions in your email'
'Hello Juno, your credit card has been declined because of an excessive amount of purchases in a differnet country'
'Click HERE to enable your credit card again'

Juno reads over the email a couple times and notices a notification on his text messages from Chase Bank.
The same kind of thing Juno see's. He clicks on the "HERE" part of the email and it sends him to a Chase 
bank website. He signs in and it sends him to a blank screen. The email is gone and the text message was
deleted from his phone.

He gets a text from Gerald saying, "Why did you post that your dropping out of school on Twitter."
Juno has lost all of his money and was reported from stealing money from the school. The hacker has stolen 
all of his money and all of his personal information. He loses his scholarship and never found out who did it
because all of the hackers messages were deleted.
