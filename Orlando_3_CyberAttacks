If your new "friend" gets your phone number and gives it to someone else than you get text messages that say click here that are used to get your email.
A malicious ad might pop up on your computer screen and then you click it then you computer has a virus on it. Than your computer shuts downs and your computer is unusable now.
An anonymous person emails you that steals your personal information to get your credit card and uses that credit card to transfer money to the stealers account.
